## Game Overview

Welcome to **Wolfenstein's-DOOM**\! This is a fast-paced, retro-style FPS inspired by the classic **Wolfenstein 3D and DOOM raycasting engine**. In this game, you take on the role of an elite cyber-operative tasked with infiltrating a fortress. Your mission: destroy the tyrannical AIs before it can unleash a new era of digital oppression.

Equipped with a single, powerful shotgun, you'll navigate a maze of deadly corridors, facing off against an army of menacing robotic guards and hostile automated defenses.
